7/5/25: I won't be able to make a update cause i'll be buying a new computer, but i will be making a few new updates for now... <:-(

How to use:

First, go to the folder "NTint", then "intelTNI" to understand how to use this, then come back when you are done. Assuming you are (now), to use intelPXI, go to the folder intelPXI and drag the "he_2" folder to your documents. Then open MounterApplication.exe, and you are done. For the best experience, please have an Intel Iris Xe Graphics Card. Or you can do whatever, I guess

There's also launchIntelOS.bat, so run that and you will see if you have Vulkan. So, if you do, you prob got OpenGL too.
By the way, you have to make a folder called "lib" and download these files:

gluegen-rt-natives-windows-amd64.jar
gluegen-rt.jar
jogl-all-natives-windows-amd64.jar
jogl-all.jar
lwjgl-glfw.jar
lwjgl-stb.jar
lwjgl-vulkan.jar
lwjgl.jar

Then run the launchIntelOS.bat file and boom, you know you have whatever you need.

Also I think you can mount this on a jail-breaked Playstaion 3 or later, and if you mounted it, please also make a tutorial too so others can do it too!

This is also compatible with NVIDIA, but I have some examples of what it does to Mirror's Edge, so go into the folder "EX" to see the screenshots I took.
I like the realistic lighting :)

By the way, Windows users who have NVIDIA or Intel, PLEASE use your control menu and Intel, use Graphics Center, and use RSTA, or Rapid Storage Technology Application, to check if any C/C++ errors are malfunctioning on your computer. 
If there is, please file an issue report, and I'll fix it.

Pictures of games that have been affected in a good way:
