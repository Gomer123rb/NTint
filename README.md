first go to the folder "intelTNI" to understand to use this, then come back when you are done. Assuming you are (now), to use intelPXI, go to the folder intelPXI and drag the "he_2" folder to your documents. then open MounterApplication.exe and you are done. for the best experience, please have a Intel iRISxe Graphics Card. or you can just do whatever i guess

theres also launchIntelOS.bat so run that and you will see if you have Vulkan. so if you do you prob got openGL too.

this is also compatible with NVIDIA but i have some examples of what it does to Mirror's Edge, so go into the folder "EX" to see the screenshots i took.
i like the realistic lighting :)
