before using intelTNI (if u dont know this literally just makes ur graphics card really REALLY good and like a NVIDIA card),
u got to move the "x86_64-8.1.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v6-rev0" straight to ur C: disk, then move the "Package" folder to ur Documents, then run the mounter. That ez!!1!
 
BTW, also for the best experience i suggest PhysX, the latest version, and intelPXI.

(and also go on full graphics!!!!! please run all games you play with the command -d3d12 )

(for the command to work please have steam installed! it will let you go to properties and do launch options!
then go and put the command -d3d12 and save by clicking out of the settings!!!)
 also this is the same with all the other worked on bundles, just wait for them to come out!
(they come out fast.)
